title: Creating a shipment from order items
---
This document describes how shipments are created from order items. Store administrators or vendors select eligible products and quantities, assign warehouses, and initiate shipment creation. The system validates eligibility, processes shipment data, saves the shipment, updates order notes, publishes events, and notifies the user.

This section governs the business logic for creating a shipment from order items, ensuring only valid, shippable items are included, and that all necessary shipment data is captured and processed according to business rules.

| Category        | Rule Name                                  | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data validation | Order and Vendor Access Validation         | A shipment can only be created if the order exists and the vendor has access to the order.                                                       |
| Data validation | Shippable Item Eligibility                 | Only order items that are shippable and have a quantity greater than zero can be included in a shipment.                                         |
| Data validation | Maximum Shippable Quantity Enforcement     | The quantity to add for each shipment item must not exceed the maximum number of items that can be shipped for that order item.                  |
| Data validation | Minimum Shipment Item Requirement          | A shipment is only created if at least one shipment item passes all eligibility checks.                                                          |
| Business logic  | Warehouse Assignment                       | The warehouse for each shipment item is determined by product settings or form input, supporting multiple warehouses if enabled.                 |
| Business logic  | Shipment Weight Calculation                | The total weight of the shipment is calculated as the sum of the weights of all shipment items.                                                  |
| Business logic  | Order Note and Event Publication           | After saving the shipment and its items, an order note is added and shipment-related events are published.                                       |
| Business logic  | Shipment Status Update                     | Shipment status is updated based on order type and form input: shipments can be shipped, marked as ready for pickup, or delivered.               |
| Business logic  | Post-Creation Notification and Redirection | After successful shipment creation, the user is notified and redirected to either the shipment details or order edit page based on their choice. |

In <SwmToken path="src/Presentation/Nop.Web/Areas/Admin/Controllers/OrderController.cs" pos="1869:12:12" line-data="    public virtual async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; AddShipment(ShipmentModel model, IFormCollection form, bool continueEditing)">`AddShipment`</SwmToken>, we start by fetching the order and its shippable items, checking vendor access, and prepping the shipment object. The function expects the form to use keys like '<SwmToken path="src/Presentation/Nop.Web/Areas/Admin/Controllers/OrderController.cs" pos="1910:3:3" line-data="            var qtyToAdd = 0; //parse quantity">`qtyToAdd`</SwmToken>{[orderItem.Id](http://orderItem.Id)}' and 'warehouse\_{[orderItem.Id](http://orderItem.Id)}' to extract quantities and warehouse IDs for each item. It loops through eligible order items, gets product info, validates quantities, figures out the warehouse (based on product settings or form input), and builds up the shipment items and total weight. No shipment is created unless at least one item passes these checks.

```c#
    public virtual async Task<IActionResult> AddShipment(ShipmentModel model, IFormCollection form, bool continueEditing)
    {
        //try to get an order with the specified id
        var order = await _orderService.GetOrderByIdAsync(model.OrderId);
        if (order == null)

        {

        }

Once shipment items are built, if there's at least one, we set the shipment's total weight, save the shipment, and then save each shipment item with the shipment's ID. This connects the items to the shipment and moves the flow forward to post-save actions.

```c#
        //if we have at least one item in the shipment, then save it
        if (shipmentItems.Any())
        {
            shipment.TotalWeight = totalWeight;
            await _shipmentService.InsertShipmentAsync(shipment);

            foreach (var shipmentItem in shipmentItems)
            {
                shipmentItem.ShipmentId = shipment.Id;
                await _shipmentService.InsertShipmentItemAsync(shipmentItem);
            }
```

After saving the shipment and its items, the function adds an order note, publishes shipment events, updates shipment status if needed, logs the edit, and shows a success notification. It then redirects to the shipment details or order edit page. If no shipment items were created, it shows an error and redirects back to <SwmToken path="src/Presentation/Nop.Web/Areas/Admin/Controllers/OrderController.cs" pos="2009:6:6" line-data="        return RedirectToAction(&quot;AddShipment&quot;, model);">`AddShipment`</SwmToken>.

```c#
            //add a note
            await _orderService.InsertOrderNoteAsync(new OrderNote
            {
                OrderId = order.Id,
                Note = "A shipment has been added",
                DisplayToCustomer = false,
                CreatedOnUtc = DateTime.UtcNow
            });

            await _eventPublisher.PublishAsync(new ShipmentCreatedEvent(shipment));

            if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(shipment.TrackingNumber))
                await _eventPublisher.PublishAsync(new ShipmentTrackingNumberSetEvent(shipment));

            var canShip = !order.PickupInStore && model.CanShip;
            if (canShip)
                await _orderProcessingService.ShipAsync(shipment, true);

            var canMarkAsReadyForPickup = order.PickupInStore && model.CanMarkAsReadyForPickup;
            if (canMarkAsReadyForPickup)
                await _orderProcessingService.ReadyForPickupAsync(shipment, true);

            if ((canShip || canMarkAsReadyForPickup) && model.CanDeliver)
                await _orderProcessingService.DeliverAsync(shipment, true);

            await LogEditOrderAsync(order.Id);

            _notificationService.SuccessNotification(await _localizationService.GetResourceAsync("Admin.Orders.Shipments.Added"));
            return continueEditing
                ? RedirectToAction("ShipmentDetails", new { id = shipment.Id })
                : RedirectToAction("Edit", new { id = model.OrderId });
